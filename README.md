This is a data science project named Real-Estate Prediction System.
Firsty build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com .
During model building I covered almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc.
